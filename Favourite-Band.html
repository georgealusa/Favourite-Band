            <p><strong>Reason For Choosing The Wailers Band</strong></p>
            
            <P>
            Boy bands come and go, but the Backstreet Boys are forever! The group has been on scene for over three decades with no signs of stopping,
            having sold over 180 million albums worldwide, making them the most popular boy band of all time in terms of sales, and one of the world's 
            best-selling music artists. I'd always pick them over any other bands because of the following reasons:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Their music never gets old. If you walk into an arena and a Backstreet song is playing, most people will be signing along. Their is a song for every emotion 
                    you could possibly ever feel. I am a fun of cheesy music, music that lightens up your soul.
                </li>
                <li>Their personalities and love for fans. It's impressive that they have the same fun-loving personalities as when they first started the group. All are very 
                    different from each other, but still extremely funny and charismatic. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Their songs make you want to join in and dance. Everyone knows signature boy band dancing, but in the '90s it was at another level. I mean, who could forget 
                    the moves in “Backstreet's Back”?
                    That signature “rock your body right” move will live on forever.
                </li>
                <li>Their undeniable swag.</li>
                <li>Their voices are so beautiful, in every single way possible. I mostly like Nick's and Kevin's voices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Robert Nests "Bob" Marley</h4>
            <p>
                Robert Nesta "Bob" Marley, (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and musician. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae,
                his musical career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as his distinctive vocal and songwriting style. 
                Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture for over a decade.
                Over the course of his career Marley became known as a Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality. 
                He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for the legalization of marijuana, while he also advocated for Pan-Africanism.

                Born in Nine Mile, British Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming Bob Marley and the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, 
                which contained the single "One Love/People Get Ready"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.
                The Wailers subsequently released eleven further studio albums; while initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, 
                which coincided with the singer's conversion to Rastafari. During this period Marley relocated to London, and the group embodied their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers (1971).

            <h4>Peter Tosh</h4>
            <p>
                Tosh was born in Westmoreland, the westernmost parish of Jamaica. He was abandoned by his parents and "shuffled among relatives. He first learned guitar after watching a man in the country play a song that captivated him. 
                He watched the man play the same song for half a day, memorizing everything his fingers were doing. He then picked up the guitar and played the song back to the man. 
                The man then asked McIntosh who had taught him to play; McIntosh told him that he had. During the early 1960s, as an aspiring musician, Tosh went to vocal teacher Joe Higgs, who gave free music lessons to young people. 
                Through his contact with Higgs, Tosh met Robert Nesta Marley (Bob Marley) and Neville O'Reilly Livingston (Bunny Wailer). He then changed his name to Peter Tosh and the trio started singing together in 1962.
                In 1964 Tosh helped organize the band the Wailing Wailers, with Junior Braithwaite, a falsetto singer, and backup singers Beverley Kelso and Cherry Smith. Initially, Tosh was the only one in the group who could play musical
                instruments. According to Bunny Wailer, Tosh was critical to the band because he was a self-taught guitarist and keyboardist, and thus became an inspiration for the other band members to learn to play.

            <h4>Bunny Wailer</h4>
            <p>
                Neville O'Riley Livingston OM OJ (10 April 1947 – 2 March 2021, known professionally as Bunny Wailer, was a Jamaican singer-songwriter and percussionist. 
                He was an original member of reggae group The Wailers along with Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. A three-time Grammy Award winner, he is considered one of the longtime standard-bearers of reggae music. 
                He was also known as Jah B, Bunny O'Riley, and Bunny Livingston.
                Wailer was born Neville O'Riley Livingston on 10 April 1947 in Kingston. He spent his earliest years in the village of Nine Mile in Saint Ann Parish. It was there that he first met Bob Marley,
                and the two young boys befriended each other quickly. The boys both came from single-parent families; Livingston was brought up by his father, Marley by his mother. 
                Later, Wailer's father Thaddeus "Thaddy Shut" Livingston lived with Marley's mother Cedella Booker in Trenchtown and had a daughter with her named Pearl Livingston. Peter Tosh had a son, Andrew Tosh, with Wailer's sister Shirley,
                making Andrew his nephew.

            <h4>Rita Marley</h4>
            <p>
                
                Alpharita Constantia Marley (née Anderson; born 25 July 1946) is a Cuban-born Jamaican singer and the widow of Bob Marley. She was a member of the vocal group the I Threes, along with Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt, 
                who gained recognition as the backing vocalists for Bob Marley and the Wailers. Rita was born in Santiago de Cuba, to Leroy Anderson and Cynthia "Beda" Jarrett. She grew up in the upper level of Beachwood Avenue,
                located in Kingston, Jamaica. In her book No Woman No Cry: My Life with Bob Marley, she describes how she was raised by her Aunt Viola on Greenwich Park Road.
                In the mid-1960s, Rita met Bob Marley after meeting Peter Tosh. After it was learned that she was a singer, she was asked to audition for the Soulettes. The group included Rita, her cousin Constantine "Dream" Walker, 
                and Marlene "Precious" Gifford. Bob Marley, then a member of the Wailers vocal trio along with Bunny Livingston and Peter Tosh, became the group's mentor and manager and through working together, he and Rita fell in love.

            <h4>Marcia Griffiths</h4>
            <p>
                Marcia Llyneth Griffiths (born 23 November 1949) is a Jamaican singer. One reviewer described her by noting "she is known primarily for her strong, smooth-as-mousse love songs and captivating live performances".
                Born in West Kingston, Jamaica, Griffiths started her career in 1964, performing on stage with Byron Lee and the Dragonaires at the behest of Phillip James of The Blues Busters, who had heard her singing in her home neighbourhood. 
                Her performance was sufficiently impressive that the following day Ronnie Nasralla and Clement Dodd both offered her recording contracts. 
                She chose to record for Dodd's Studio One label, where she recorded a series of duets with male singers such as Tony Gregory ("You're Mine"), Bob Marley ("Oh My Darling"), Jeff Dixon ("Words"),
                and Bob Andy ("Always Together"), with whom she would have a relationship lasting several years. In 1968 she had her first success as a solo artist, with "Feel Like Jumping", 
                which like her other early Studio One solo hits (including "Truly" and "Melody Life"), were written by Andy.
                From 1970 to 1974, she worked together with Bob Andy as a duo (Bob and Marcia), on the Harry J label. She also recorded for Lloyd Charmers.
                Between 1974 and 1981, she was a member of the I Threes, a trio of backing singers, which supported Bob Marley & the Wailers. 
                She continued to record as a solo artist throughout the 1970s, working with producers such as Sonia Pottinger, and Joseph Hoo Kim.
